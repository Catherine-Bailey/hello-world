Ya. No idea what's going on here really, but at least that is apparently how you keep your brain young, so here we go.
Write a bit about yourself. Okay. Ocassionally I find my own life boring. Which is strange since boredom is subjective. So then I google things liek "Why is my life so damn boring" and it provides some anecdotal responses about saying yes to more shit. So I try that for a few days. Is that enough about me?
